# Text catalogue

What each entry of the game's two string tables is for, so that writers
of an open pack can write new text for it without the original. The
format is in [asset-packs.md](asset-packs.md), section "Open text"; this
file only says what to write where.

Licensing: the open pack's text must be new writing. This catalogue
describes each entry's role in its own words and never quotes the
original; keep it that way when you update it.

## How to read it

- **Index:** the key in `text/<lang>/cstr.json` (`"strings"`) or
  `text/<lang>/cstn.json` (`"groups"`).
- **Where shown:** the screen, and the engine's name for the entry
  (`S_*`, `W_*` in `src/ui/screens.c`) when it has one.
- **`%s` arguments:** what the engine fills in, in order. An entry
  keeps this order; it may leave out trailing arguments, and `%1$s` to
  `%9$s` take any argument by its number.
- **Markup:** `\n` line break, `~` at a line start a menu option (the
  count and order are fixed where noted: the code gives each option its
  meaning), `` ` `` at a paragraph start a drop capital, `^` an
  apostrophe. Text boxes have a fixed width and wrap; very long text
  runs off the screen.
- **Not used by the engine:** nothing reads the entry. A pack may leave
  it out (it is then empty); the role is given for completeness.
  `tools/artgen/coverage.py` reads these markers (and "empty in the
  original") and the word counts, to report only what the engine reads:
  keep them in step with the code.
- Amounts written in the text (prices, debts) must match the rules: the
  notes give the constant to keep in step with.

## Notes on the original

Found while writing this catalogue. The engine follows the original in
each case; they explain entries that are never shown.

- Groups 66 and 67, and words 22-23 of group 43, are never shown: the
  verdict reads group 44 + rating, and the rating is 0-21 (`hof_rating()`,
  "Retirement and the Hall of Fame" in
  game-rules.md).
- Group 20, words 20 and 21 (a convoy arriving in a town) are never
  logged (game-rules.md, "The treasure fleet and the silver train").
- String 298 names a debt; the original, and `sim_merchant_pay_debt`,
  take 500 gold. Write the amount the rules take.
