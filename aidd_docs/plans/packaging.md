# Packaging: a playable game on Windows, FreeBSD, macOS and Linux

Goal: one download per platform that plays the whole game from the open
pack, with no original data, and still reads a player's own GOG
`DATA.DAT` when given.

## Where it stands (2026-10-30)

- The engine builds on all four systems (README); Windows through the
  llvm-mingw cross toolchain, its tests run under Wine.
- The open game data is complete (open-game-data.md, G1-G4): the game
  and `flibustier-sim` run from the open pack alone (`--pack`, no
  `--data`), and the career bot plays full twelve-year careers on it.
- The open pack (`~/flibustier-openpack`, 227 MB: art 155, music 58,
  data 5, provenance 8) is a draft: its pictures are 8-step renders.
- No install rules, no release builds, no CI. The game finds its data
  only through `--data`, `--pack` or `FLIBUSTIER_DATA`; saves default to
  `~/.local/share/flibustier/saves` on every system.

## Blockers outside the code

1. ~~The art's licence~~: CC0 1.0 (maintainer, 2026-10-31).
2. **The music** belongs to its author (`music/CREDITS.txt`): written
   permission to redistribute it in the packages, or packages without
   it (P1 decides what plays then).
3. **Final renders**: the draft pictures are to be re-rendered at full
   quality before a 1.0 (the art session's work, not this plan's).

## Phases

### P1. Gaps of the open pack alone

Done (2026-10-31):

- The 7 spoken sound effects (`sound/hail`, `sail-ho`, `harbour`,
  `land-battle`, `last-man`, `hit-foe`, `hit-you`) recorded by the
  maintainer (CC0, 2026-10-31), cleaned with ffmpeg (trim, EQ, gate,
  loudness; each provenance file gives the edit). `voices.toml` marks
  them `recorded`, so `tools/sfxgen/voicegen.py` (Dia2) never renders
  over them; it stays for any voice added later.
- Text entry 318, the cabin's language menu, in the three languages.
- `tools/artgen/coverage.py` counts the original assets the pack
  replaces in another form as done (`tiles15/sbtl`, `lbtl` by the
  Tiled battle screens, `pic/map1560` by `map/1560`, `pic/baseflag`,
  whose palette trick true-colour flags do not need).
- `music/prize` (the capture's tune): a whistled tune the maintainer
  recorded (CC0, 2026-10-31). The open pack now covers every asset ID.

### P2. The engine finds its own data

Each package holds the program and the open pack side by side (a zip
or a self-extracting archive, a macOS application bundle), so the
program looks for its pack beside itself (maintainer, 2026-10-30).

- **Done:** with no `--pack`, the game adds the `openpack` directory
  beside its program (`<dir>/openpack/pack.ini`), or in a macOS
  bundle `Contents/Resources/openpack`. The program's directory comes
  from the system (`src/data/progdir.c`: Windows, macOS, FreeBSD,
  Linux), else `argv[0]`. `--data` and `FLIBUSTIER_DATA` still add a
  player's own data under it; `--pack` replaces it.
- **Saves:** still `--saves`, `FLIBUSTIER_SAVES`, else
  `~/.local/share/flibustier/saves`; on Windows and macOS that path is
  to move to `%APPDATA%\Flibustier` and
  `~/Library/Application Support/Flibustier` with the packages (P3).

### P3. Install rules

Done (2026-10-31); README "Installing with the open pack":

- The pack's licence: CC0 1.0 (maintainer, 2026-10-31) for all of it
  but the remade music (its author's) and the fonts (OFL), in the
  pack's `LICENSE` and `pack.ini`.
- CMake `install()` in the `game` component: `flibustier`,
  `flibustier-sim`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `MANUAL.md`, and the pack
  named by `FLIBUSTIER_OPENPACK` without its provenance and coverage
  report. A system layout (`bin`, `share/flibustier/openpack`,
  `share/doc/flibustier`; the game looks there from `bin`, P2) or,
  with `FLIBUSTIER_PORTABLE` (Windows' default), all in one directory.
- The remade music is installed by default (maintainer, 2026-10-31);
  `FLIBUSTIER_OPENPACK_MUSIC=OFF` leaves out its files, its fragment
  and its credits block: a credits block may name the
  asset it credits (`needs`), and goes when no pack gives it. The
  recorded tunes (`pack.d/recordings.ini`, CC0) stay.
- `FLIBUSTIER_BUNDLED_DEPS` builds raylib and FreeType in statically
  (the Windows build already links everything but the system DLLs).
- Checked: Release installs on FreeBSD (system layout, no music;
  portable, with music) and Windows (portable, under Wine) start with
  no option and reach the credits from the installed pack; the FreeBSD
  and Windows screens are identical. The package is 167 MB without
  the music, 223 MB with it.

### P4. One package per platform

| System | Package | Built on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | zip (and later an installer) | FreeBSD, llvm-mingw cross build (as now) | the pack beside the `.exe`; checked under Wine, then on a real Windows |
| macOS | `Flibustier.app` in a `.dmg` | a Mac (or CI macOS runner) | universal binary (arm64 + x86_64); unsigned at first: Gatekeeper asks once; signing and notarisation need a paid Apple developer account (maintainer) |
| Linux | AppImage, and a `.tar.gz` | CI Linux runner, oldest glibc in use | Flatpak later (Flathub) |
| FreeBSD | a port (`games/flibustier`, pack as `games/flibustier-openpack`) | this host | the pack as its own port: it changes less often and is large |

CPack makes the zip, tarball and dmg from the P3 rules; the AppImage
and the FreeBSD port have their own tools.

**Windows zip, done (2026-10-31):** `cpack` in the cross build
directory makes `flibustier-<version>-openpack-<pack tag or
commit>-windows-x86_64.zip` (223 MB with the music), one folder holding
`flibustier.exe`, `flibustier-sim.exe`, `openpack/` and the documents;
elsewhere it makes the same as a tarball. The game is a windowed program
on Windows (no console window on a double click) that reattaches to the
console it is started from (`src/console.c`). Checked under Wine: the
unzipped game starts with no option from another directory, prints its
messages, honours redirected output, and draws the same credits as the
FreeBSD install. The maintainer played it on Windows 11 (2026-10-31):
it works.

**The program's icon, done (2026-10-31):** an original drawing (a pirate ship
with a skull on its main sail, at dusk; BSD-2-Clause) in `desktop/flibustier.svg`;
`tools/icons.py` renders the committed PNG sizes, `flibustier.ico` and
`flibustier.icns` from it (reproducible, needs `rsvg-convert`). Windows:
a resource of the `.exe` named `GLFW_ICON`, shown by Explorer and by
GLFW on the window. Unix: the game hands its window the 64 px PNG,
built in; a system install adds `share/applications/flibustier.desktop`
and the `hicolor` icons (`StartupWMClass` matches the window's
`flibustier` class). macOS: `flibustier.icns` in the bundle's
`Contents/Resources`, named by `CFBundleIconFile` (not yet built on a
Mac). Checked: the resources in the
cross-built `.exe` (llvm-readobj), the staged install's files; the X11
window icon not yet seen on a screen. The FreeBSD port's plist needs the
new files.

**macOS dmg, done (2026-10-31):** on a Mac, `cpack` in a universal
Release build (`-DFLIBUSTIER_BUNDLED_DEPS=ON
-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64" -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0`)
makes `flibustier-<version>-openpack-<pack tag or commit>-darwin-universal.dmg`
(221 MB with the music): `Flibustier.app` (bundle id
`org.flibustier.Flibustier`, `cmake/Info.plist.in`, the executable is
`Contents/MacOS/Flibustier`), the pack in `Contents/Resources/openpack`,
the documents beside it, an `Applications` link. `flibustier-sim` stays
out. The install ends with an ad hoc `codesign --force --deep -s -`:
without it the bundle is "not signed at all" (only the linker's
signature on the binary), and `codesign -v --deep --strict` fails.
Checked: `lipo -info` gives x86_64 and arm64; `otool -L` lists only
`/usr/lib` and `/System` (OpenGL, Cocoa, IOKit, CoreFoundation, ...);
`codesign -v` valid on the mounted dmg and on a copy in `/tmp`; the copy
run from `/` with no option draws the credits; a double click opens a
frontmost window and loads CoreAudio. Left: hearing the sound, a run on
Intel, Gatekeeper's first-run prompt on a downloaded (quarantined) copy,
the icon, saves in `~/Library/Application Support/Flibustier`.

**FreeBSD ports, written (2026-10-31), not committed:**
`games/flibustier` (the engine from GitHub at a commit, system raylib
and FreeType, depends on the pack) and `games/flibustier-openpack` (the
pack, `MUSIC` option on by default) in the maintainer's ports tree.
GitHub's archives of the pack hold Git LFS pointers, not the files, so
the pack port fetches release tarballs made by
`tools/openpack_dist.py` (reproducible; the remade music in a tarball
of its own) from the pack's `openpack-<version>` GitHub release. While
the music's author has not given permission, its licence allows no
mirroring, so the official package builders skip the port with the
music on. Checked: both ports stage with no plist issues, with the
music and without; the staged game starts on the staged pack.
Left: the `openpack-0.1` release upload, a poudriere run.

### P5. Releases

**0.1, made by hand (2026-10-31):** tags `v0.1.0` (engine) and
`openpack-0.1` (pack, its tarballs from `tools/openpack_dist.py`, checked
reproducible), the Windows zip
`flibustier-0.1.0-openpack-0.1-windows-x86_64.zip` and, built on the
maintainer's Mac, `flibustier-0.1.0-openpack-0.1-darwin-universal.dmg`
(both with the music, the maintainer's choice) attached to the engine's
GitHub release, the FreeBSD ports moved to them. Linux: a Flatpak bundle
(`desktop/org.flibustier.Flibustier.yml`, built on framework2 with the
26.08 runtime; raylib for X11 only, Wayland through XWayland) on the same
release; v0.1.0 does not build with GCC 14 and later (`progdir.c`), so
the manifest applied the fixes made since as a patch, dropped in 0.1.1.
Checked: installed from the bundle, it starts headless and draws the
credits. Left: Flathub (the metainfo's licence must name the pack's
terms), a window and sound seen on a Linux desktop. CI below is still to
do.

**0.1.1 (2026-11-07):** tags `v0.1.1` (the crew and standing overflows,
the protocol's cannon board, the GCC 14 build) and `openpack-0.2` (the
captains who stand and fight, the nations' flags over the towns, the
speed arrow on the sea battle panel), the packages named
`flibustier-0.1.1-openpack-0.2-*`. The Flatpak manifest builds the tag
unpatched, and takes the pack's 0.2 tarballs at the hashes
`tools/openpack_dist.py` gives on the pack's `openpack-0.2` commit.

- Versions: the engine and the pack tagged apart (`v0.x`,
  `openpack-0.x`); a package names both.
- CI (GitHub Actions): build and test on Linux, macOS and Windows (the
  mingw cross build), make the packages on a tag, attach them to the
  GitHub release. The pack's art comes from Git LFS: CI must fetch it
  (`git lfs pull`), within the free LFS bandwidth or from a release
  asset instead.
- Each package is checked by starting the game headless from the
  package (`flibustier --script ...`) before it is attached.

## Order

P1 and P2 first (they make the open game whole and self-starting,
whatever the licences); P3-P5 once blockers 1 and 2 are settled, since
nothing can be published before.

## Decisions for the maintainer

1. ~~The art's licence~~: CC0.
2. The music: permission from its author, or packages without it.
3. macOS signing and notarisation: pay for an Apple developer account,
   or ship unsigned.
4. Where releases live: GitHub releases, plus the FreeBSD port.
